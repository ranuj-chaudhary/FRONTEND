// PERFORMACE STRATEGIES
/*
1) Send less code to the browser. (Code Splitting)
2) Cache expensive calculations to re-use from render to render.
3) Avoid unneccessary re-renders.
4) Re-structure the application
*/

// Caveats
/*
 - React is already fast (reconsilation)
 - Don't prematurely optimise
 - Balance optimisations with readability/maintainability.
*/

// INDEX
/*
WHAT WILL I LEARN IN REACT PERFORMANCE?

- How react renders components?
    -> Recursive Rendering
    -> Three Phase of rendering
    
- Strict Equality
- React.StrictMode
- Code Splitting
- useMemo()
- useCallback()
- React.memo()
- using dev tools measuring perfomance
